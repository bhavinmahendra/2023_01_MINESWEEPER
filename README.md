This is the implementation of the classic game Minesweeper. To run the code, use the following line to play: minas(col, lin, n, dim, s), with
 - col is a letter, the columns of the grid
 - lin is a number, the number of lines of the grid
 - n is a number, the number of mines
 - dim is the dimension and s the seed for a pseudo random generator (both numbers)

Note: This is an academic project. The idea of the project came from Albert Abad (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal)
